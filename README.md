ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about the basics of data analysis, to further establish skills in epidemiology--a data driven subset of public health.  With Covid-19 happening globally, I'm hoping to help contribute to the output of health driven data that is both informative and attainable by the general public.
